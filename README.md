# Anomaly-based-Intrusion-Detection-Technique-for-IoT-Enabled-Smart-Cities
This research proposes a two- level classification technique for the anomaly detection-based IDS architecture for fog-edge sides. Targeted for IoT-smart city networks, the upper layer network uses a gradient boosting classifier while the lower layer network employs deep learning (DL) based on  a convolutional neural network (CNN).
